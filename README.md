# Figma_PPD_Prototype
This is a prototype for a Maternal Postpartum digital health tool submitted for BIS 640: User Centered Design for Digital Health Tools.

Topic: The postpartum period can be a very transformative and often daunting phase of a woman's life. Postpartum mental health issues, such as postpartum depression and anxiety, affect many new mothers, impacting their emotional well-being during a vulnerable period post childbirth.

Aim: To create a digital health tool, offering a comprehensive and accessible solution; providing timely support, educational resources, tracking tools, and connections to healthcare professionals and supportive communities, all within the convenience of a single platform, crucial for addressing the multifaceted nature of postpartum mental health challenges.

Process: We initially conducted an extensive literature review followed by social listening,  surveys and Interviews. This lead to us creating a Affinity diagram with what the potential users wanted. 

We were a group of 4 members.

This app was ideated with Dr. Terika McCall and our team; Was designed by: Varada K.
